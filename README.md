Features:

1. Choose your own specific .txt file from any directory (WIP)
2. Prints longest word in .txt file
3. Prints most common word in .txt file
4. Option to print all words in the .txt file along with their occurrences
5. Option to search for a word and return its number of occurrences.


## Running

2. Choose a .txt file
3. Follow the instructions to receive various information about the content of your file
