# Text-Info
Text Info is my first independent programming project from scratch. The program will give the user various details about a given .txt file, with more features to come.

Features:

1. Choose your own specific .txt file from any directory (WIP)
2. Prints longest word in .txt file
3. Prints most common word in .txt file
4. Option to print all words in the .txt file along with their occurrences
5. Option to search for a word and return its number of occurrences.
